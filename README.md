# Data-Mining
Project and practice about data mining

This code demonstrates the implementation and testing of a simple Perceptron algorithm, a fundamental building block in neural networks. It includes functions for training the perceptron (Perceptron), making predictions (PredictPerceptron), and visualizing the decision boundary (PlotPerceptron). The notebook then applies this algorithm to solve two examples, likely representing basic logic gates (NAND and NOR), showing the training process, prediction results, and a graphical representation of the learned decision boundary.
